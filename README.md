# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters.  
Using a Random Forest Classifier, the model analyzes input features to provide an early diagnosis, which can be crucial in preventive healthcare.

## Dataset

The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, exercise-induced angina, and more.  
Data preprocessing includes one-hot encoding for categorical variables to ensure the model handles data correctly.
